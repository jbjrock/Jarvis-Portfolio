            <img src="assets/images/jbpic.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Jarvis Maness">

            <p>Iâ€™m a North Carolina native that is an inspired software and web developer. My goal is to use the skills
                that I have accommodated over the years to become an intuitive Full Stack developer. Skills such as
                HTML, CSS, JAVA SCRIPT, and MY SQL will allow me to be creative and use problem solving techniques to be
                successful in a extremely demanding field.</p>

            <p>The reason I have choosen this career path is due to the advanced technology and creative side of the
                field. Seeing that new and innovative technology is the poioneer that is shaping our entire culture, I
                am extremely proud to be apart of it.</p>
